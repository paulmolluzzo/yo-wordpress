== Yo Wordpress ==

This is a simple integration of the Yo service for Wordpress. It will track Yo subscribers and allow you to send a Yo when you make a new Post.

== How to Use ==

1. Grab a [Yo API Key](http://api.justyo.co) and make the callback URL your Wordpress home page URL.
2. Go to the Yo Worpress page in the Plugins menu.
3. Enter your Yo API Key and click "Save Yo API Key".

Now when you write some posts you'll send a Yo to all your subscribers. As you gain subscribers, they'll get listed in the table on the Yo Wordpress admin page.
